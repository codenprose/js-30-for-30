    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Allen';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Alan Turing',
      contribution: 'Computer Science'
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const legend = person;
    // legend.name = 'Linus Torvalds'; // this will change the person object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const legend = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Linus Torvalds' });
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const legend = {...person, name: ''}
